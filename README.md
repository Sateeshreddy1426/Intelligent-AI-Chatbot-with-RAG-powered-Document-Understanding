# Intelligent-AI-Chatbot-with-RAG-powered-Document-Understanding

Project Overview

This project implements an AI-powered chatbot that integrates Generative AI (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver real-time, document-aware responses. The chatbot is integrated with Kore.ai, ensuring seamless and dynamic enterprise-ready conversational AI solutions.

Key Features

RAG-based Knowledge Retrieval: The chatbot retrieves relevant information from PDFs, APIs, and databases before formulating responses.

Kore.ai Integration: The chatbot dynamically processes user queries via a webhook API, enabling intelligent interactions.

Vector Search with ChromaDB: Efficient indexing and retrieval of documents through vector search capabilities.

Scalable Deployment: The solution is deployed on AWS/GCP using Docker and Flask for reliability and scalability.

Custom Knowledge Base: Supports multiple data sources, including PDFs, scraped web pages, and real-time API data, ensuring a robust knowledge repository.



Tech Stack

LLMs: OpenAI/GPT-based models for generating intelligent responses.

RAG Framework: Enables document-aware AI conversations.

ChromaDB: Vector database for fast and efficient retrieval.

Kore.ai: Provides NLP and chatbot orchestration.

Flask: API backend for processing and handling queries.

Docker: Containerization for scalable deployment.

Cloud Platforms: AWS/GCP for hosting and integration.

Implementation Details

Data Ingestion

Extracts text from PDFs, web pages, and APIs.

Converts extracted text into vector embeddings using a pre-trained transformer model.

Stores embeddings in ChromaDB for efficient retrieval.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Processing

When a user submits a query, the chatbot retrieves the most relevant information from ChromaDB.

The retrieved context is then fed into the LLM to generate a response.

Kore.ai Webhook Integration

The chatbot is connected to Kore.ai via a webhook API.

Queries from Kore.ai are processed, and responses are sent back dynamically.

Deployment & Scalability

Packaged using Docker for easy deployment.

Hosted on AWS/GCP with load balancing to handle enterprise-scale queries.

Future Enhancements

Fine-tuning LLMs for improved domain-specific accuracy.

Real-time knowledge updates for continuous learning.

Multi-modal support for handling images, audio, and videos in responses.

Advanced security measures for enterprise-grade data protection.

Conclusion

This RAG-powered AI chatbot revolutionizes enterprise AI interactions by providing intelligent, document-aware responses. Its seamless integration with Kore.ai and scalable architecture makes it a powerful tool for businesses looking to enhance their customer service and knowledge management solutions.
